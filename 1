Tell us about the most challenging/interesting task you've solved. It can be a personal project or something you’ve worked on professionally. Just a short paragraph is fine, but I’d love to know why you’re proud of it.

 One of the most challenging and interesting task I've solved was connection the old code of application with Mailchimp API. The application is written on ruby 1.8.7 and rails 2.0. So, that was the feelings of joy and satisfaction, when I finally got answer "OK" from API.
